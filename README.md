The project â€œIdentification and Traceability System" proposed by Pulse.digital Maroc and inspired by the identification and traceability of tobacco products on the EU market aims to follow the product throughout its life cycle, from the production chain of a factory to the last economic operator before the first retail point of sale. 
This system will use unique identifiers (UIDs) to track products, each product will have a unique identifier in the system that will allow to know the status of the product during its life cycle
